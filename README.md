## General Information
- 'Lending Club is a marketplace for various types of loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. 
Whne the company receives a loan application ,company has to make decision for loan approval based on applicant's profile.

There are two types of risks are associated with the bankâ€™s decision:

(i) If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
(ii) If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
Based on the dataset supplied company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.



## Conclusions
(1) Loan Term: Average Interest rate for defaulted applications is very high with 12.38 % for 36 months and 15.75 % for 60 months term.
