## General Information
- A consumer finance company named 'Lending Club' specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, it has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
There are two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

(i) If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
(ii) If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
Based on the dataset supplied company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.



## Conclusions
(1) Loan Term: Average Interest rate for defaulted applications is very high with 12.38 % for 36 months and 15.75 % for 60 months term.

(2) Grade: Default Rate is high in high risk loan applicants. It would be important for LC to thoroughly vet high risk loan applications.

(3) Loan Purpose: The top two reasons for loans are debt consolidation and credit card. Such applications should be carefully assessed.

(4) Loan Issue Month: The most common month the loan is issued is December.
